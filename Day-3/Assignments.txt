Task 6: Ask the user to input two numbers. Check if at least one of the numbers is greater than 50 using the or operator.

Task 7: Ask the user to enter a boolean value (True/False). Use the not operator to reverse the boolean value and print the result.

Task 8: Create a variable x with an initial value of 10. Then, use assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) to perform the following:

 ( Add 5 to x

 Subtract 3 from x

 Multiply x by 2

 Divide x by 4 ) 

Task 9: Ask the user for a number and double the value using an assignment operator (*=). Print the result.
