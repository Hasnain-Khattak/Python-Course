*************** For Loops Taskas:*********************************************

Task 1: Print each character in a string

Ask the user to input a string, and use a for loop to print each character of the string on a new line.

Task 2: Sum of a list of numbers

Create a list of numbers and use a for loop to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list. Print the result.

Task 3: Count the vowels in a string

Ask the user to input a string. Use a for loop to count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are in the string and print the result.


******While Loop Tasks:*****

Task 1: Guess the number

Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. The user should keep guessing the number until they guess it correctly using a while loop.

Task 2: Print numbers from 1 to 5

Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

Task 3: Sum of numbers until zero

Write a program that keeps asking the user for a number and adds it to a running total until the user inputs 0, then print the total.

Task 4: Countdown timer

Create a countdown timer using a while loop that starts from 10 and counts down to 1, printing each number.

Task 5: Repeat asking for a valid input

Keep asking the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. If the number is outside this range, ask again until they input a valid number.
