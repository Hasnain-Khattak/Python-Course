# Mini Project: Word Frequency Analyzer

# Step 1: Ask the user to input a sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# Step 2: Create a list of words using list comprehension
words = sentence.split()

# Step 3: Count the frequency of each word using a dictionary
word_count = {}
for word in words:
    word_count[word] = word_count.get(word, 0) + 1

# Step 4: Filter out words that appear only once using a list comprehension
frequent_words = [word for word in word_count if word_count[word] > 1]

# Step 5: Print the list of words that appear more than once
print(frequent_words)
